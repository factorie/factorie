Coding:
Finish belief propagation message-passing 
Re-consider type arguments in Sampler and descendants
Get basic optimize package working
Implement BFGS

Low Priority Coding:
Implement Forany2 in logic1
Fix IntTerm in logic1
Support inference over relations in er1
Make an example for er2 and logic2
Create simple infrastructure for non-relational generative Bayes nets

Testing:
Create more unit tests!
Why does LDA get much slower when you tell the sampler not to create DiffLists.  I expected the opposite! 

Documentation:
Clean up all examples
Put in ACE coref example
Put in final spanner example
Create a Gaussian mixture example
Write README.txt
Write manual in package.html
Document how to get a factorie interpretter prompt
